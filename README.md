# YouTube_Playlist_Downloader

This is a Python program that downloads all YouTube videos in a user-specified playlist. For running the code, follow these steps:

1. Type sudo apt-get update in the terminal. This will update all the necessary packages for running the    installation script.

2. Run the installationScript.sh file.
   Eg.- if the file's path is /home/user/Files, then type
        chmod 700 /home/user/Files/installationScript.sh
        then type
        /home/user/Files/installationScript.sh  This will install the necessary modules required for running the  program

3. Create a 'filePath.txt' file in the same location as the downloader's script. Keep it blank. This is necessary

4. Run the program. On the first run, you will be required to specify the location where the videos are to be downloaded. This location will be used everytime you run the code in th future.

5. Paste the URL of the youtube playlist when prompted.

6. And you are done! Just don't quit the terminal until all videos have been downloaded, else the download will be stopped
